# Crownstone logger for node projects

This is a shared logger library for all Crownstone node libraries and projects. It is based on [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston). 

## Environmental variables

These can be set (including defaults):

```
CS_FILE_LOGGING_BASENAME='crownstone-log'
CS_FILE_LOGGING_LEVEL='info'
CS_CONSOLE_LOGGING_LEVEL='info'
CS_ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING=
```

It is possible to set a process argument `--silent`. Moreover, file logging is not enabled when `CS_ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING` isn't present in the environment.
